# Autosuggestion
A typeahead system, often called autocomplete, is a feature in software programs that predicts the rest of a word or phrase that a user is typing. This functionality helps users to find and select from a pre-populated list of values as they type, reducing the amount of typing needed and making the input process faster and more efficient.
